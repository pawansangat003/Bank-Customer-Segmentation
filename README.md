# Understood how to leverage the power of machine learning to transform marketing departments and perform customer segmentation and following are some methods that i learned:
  1. Applied k-means clustering algorithm in scikit-Learn to perform customer segmentation and obtained optimal number of clusters using elbow method.
  2. Applied principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and data visualization.
  3. Compiled and fitted unsupervised machine learning models such as PCA and K-Means to training data.
